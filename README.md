# OpenAI API and Dalle2 Code Examples

This repository contains three code snippets that demonstrate the usage of the OpenAI API and the Dalle2 engine to perform various image-related tasks.

## dalle2.ipynb: Image Generation from Prompt

The code in this section demonstrates how to generate images based on a given prompt using the OpenAI API. It sends a prompt about a "cat playing inside a box" and receives a set of generated images in response.

## edit_dalle2.ipynb: Image Editing with Mask

In this section, the code showcases the process of performing image editing with the help of a mask. It sends an edit request using an image and a mask, along with a prompt, and receives an edited image as a response.

## variation_dalle2.ipynb: Image Variation Generation

The code provided in this section illustrates how to create variations of an input image using the OpenAI API. It generates two variations of a "redpanda.png" image, each of size 1024x1024 pixels.
